<h2>About our Restaurant</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#000000;">
    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>

Five generations ago the Calamigos Ranch opened its first restaurant on the same spot where the Malibu Cafe Country Kitchen and Bar is located. Owned and operated as it is today, by the Gerson Family, the first (of many) signature items was born; the Calamigos Barbeque Sauce.<br>
<br>
 

With their roots planted firmly in the cowboy lifestyle, illustrating the rugged brand of living off the land, Grant and Helen Walter Gerson created what is today known as Calamigos Ranch.<br>
<br>



 Over 80 years later, we would like to welcome you back to Calamigos Ranch for a dining experience wrapped deeply in rustic California heritage, honoring the cowboys and cowgirls that came before us, for a fashion cuisine unlike any other.<br>
 <br>
 

 We welcome you to the Malibu Cafe, a breathtaking dining experience we call Nouveau Barbeque. With signature dishes created generations ago, paired with modern cooking techniques and flavors, we are proud to honor our ancestors and introduce you to a few of the many things that make California timeless.</p>
